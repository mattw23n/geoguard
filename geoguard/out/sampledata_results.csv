SAMPLE-001,Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,YES,0.85,Legal compliance detected (see phrasebook cues).,UT-SMRA,age_gating,"To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL (Age-sensitive logic) to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH (Geo-handler; module for routing features by user region) to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace (Log tracing mode for compliance verification) for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode (Deploy feature in non-user-impact way to collect analytics only) during initial rollout.","""Social media platforms must disable personalized feeds for users under 18 by default."" | ""Providers must implement mechanisms to restrict access to content in compliance with EU law."""
SAMPLE-002,PF default toggle with NR enforcement for California teens,REVIEW,0.5,Insufficient evidence.,,,"As part of compliance with California’s SB976, the app will disable PF (Personalized feed) by default for users under 18 located in California. This default setting is considered NR (Not recommended (content/user status)) to override, unless explicit parental opt-in is provided. Geo-detection is handled via GH (Geo-handler; module for routing features by user region), and rollout is monitored with FR (Feature rollout status) logs. The design ensures minimal disruption while meeting the strict personalization requirements imposed by the law.",
SAMPLE-003,Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,YES,0.85,Legal compliance detected (see phrasebook cues).,,,"In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC, this feature scans uploads and flags suspected materials tagged as T5 (Tier 5 sensitivity data; highly sensitive per internal taxonomy). Once flagged, the CDS (Compliance Detection System) auto-generates reports and routes them via secure channel APIs. The logic runs in real-time, supports human validation, and logs detection metadata for internal audits. Regional thresholds are governed by LCP (Local compliance policy) parameters in the backend.","""Social media platforms must disable personalized feeds for users under 18 by default."" | ""Providers must implement mechanisms to restrict access to content in compliance with EU law."""
SAMPLE-004,Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,REVIEW,0.5,Insufficient evidence.,,,"To meet the transparency expectations of the EU Digital Services Act, we are introducing a visibility lock for flagged user-generated content labeled under NSP (Non-shareable policy (content should not be shared externally)). When such content is detected, a soft Softblock (User-level limitation applied silently without notifications) is applied and GH (Geo-handler; module for routing features by user region) ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace (Log tracing mode for compliance verification) supports traceability, and Redline (Flag for legal review) status can be triggered for legal review. This feature enhances accountability and complies with Article 16’s removal mechanisms.",
SAMPLE-005,Jellybean-based parental notifications for Florida regulation,YES,0.85,Legal compliance detected (see phrasebook cues).,,age_gating,"To support Florida's Online Protections for Minors law, this feature extends the Jellybean (Internal parental control system) parental control framework. Notifications are dispatched to verified parent accounts when a minor attempts to access restricted features. Using IMT (Internal monitoring trigger), the system checks behavioral anomalies against BB (Baseline behavior used for anomaly detection) models. If violations are detected, restrictions are applied in ShadowMode (Deploy feature in non-user-impact way to collect analytics only) with full audit logging through CDS (Compliance Detection System).

SAMPLE-007,NSP auto-flagging,REVIEW,0.5,Insufficient evidence.,,,"This feature will automatically detect and tag content that violates NSP (Non-shareable policy (content should not be shared externally)) policy. Once flagged, Softblock (User-level limitation applied silently without notifications) is applied and a Redline (Flag for legal review) alert is generated if downstream sharing is attempted.",
SAMPLE-008,T5 tagging for sensitive reports,REVIEW,0.5,Insufficient evidence.,,,"When users report content containing high-risk information, it is tagged as T5 (Tier 5 sensitivity data; highly sensitive per internal taxonomy) for internal routing. CDS (Compliance Detection System) then enforces escalation. The system is universal and does not rely on regional toggles or GH (Geo-handler; module for routing features by user region) routes.",
SAMPLE-009,Underage protection via Snowcap trigger,YES,0.85,Legal compliance detected (see phrasebook cues).,,age_gating,"Snowcap (Child-safety policy framework) is activated for all underage users platform-wide, applying ASL (Age-sensitive logic) to segment accounts. Actions taken under this logic are routed to CDS (Compliance Detection System) and monitored using BB (Baseline behavior used for anomaly detection) to identify deviations in usage.","""Social media platforms must disable personalized feeds for users under 18 by default."" | ""Providers must implement mechanisms to restrict access to content in compliance with EU law."""

SAMPLE-012,Leaderboard system for weekly creators,NO,0.95,Business geofence detected (see phrasebook cues).,,,Introduce a creator leaderboard updated weekly using internal analytics. Points and rankings are stored in FR (Feature rollout status) metadata and tracked using IMT (Internal monitoring trigger).,
SAMPLE-013,Mood-based PF enhancements,REVIEW,0.5,Insufficient evidence.,,,Adjust PF (Personalized feed) recommendations based on inferred mood signals from emoji usage.
