Direct Messaging for All Users,"A new feature to allow any user to send a direct message to any other user, including minors. No filters or parental controls are planned for V1.","PRD: The goal is to increase user engagement by enabling open communication. All users, regardless of age, will have this feature enabled by default. We will not be implementing reporting or blocking in the initial release.","TRD: The messaging service will use a standard WebSocket connection. Messages are stored unencrypted in our database to allow for future analytics.",YES
Image ALT-Text Generator,"An accessibility feature that uses AI to automatically generate descriptive ALT text for all images uploaded to the platform, making the site more usable for visually impaired users via screen readers.","PRD: To comply with accessibility standards like ADA and EAA, all user-uploaded images must have descriptive alt-text. This feature will auto-generate it if the user doesn't provide it.","TRD: The feature will use a pre-trained image captioning model. No user data is sent to third parties. The model runs on our own infrastructure.",NO
Profile Anonymizer with Location Tracking,"A premium feature allowing users to make their profile anonymous. However, the system still collects location data in the background without explicit disclosure.","PRD: This feature is for user privacy. However, for monetization, we will continue to track user location data for targeted advertising, even when their profile is anonymized. This is noted in our Terms of Service.","TRD: The mobile app will continue to ping the device's GPS coordinates every 5 minutes and send them to our ad-tech partners. This functionality is independent of the anonymizer setting.",YES
Parental Control Dashboard,"A comprehensive dashboard for parents to manage their child's account. This includes setting time limits, disabling direct messaging from strangers, and reviewing their friend list.","PRD: To enhance child safety and align with the UK Online Safety Act, this dashboard gives parents full control over their child's interactions. This feature is designed to mitigate risks associated with minors on the platform.","TRD: The dashboard will require parental verification via a one-time payment of $0.50 to a credit card, a standard method for age/guardian verification (as per COPPA).",NO
Downloads Blocked in France,"A feature that allows users to download videos from the platform. To comply with local copyright agreements, the download functionality will be disabled for all users located in France.","PRD: The feature will be available across the EU, but a geo-block must be implemented for France due to specific content licensing restrictions. The legal team has confirmed this is a hard requirement.","TRD: The backend will check the user's IP address against a geo-database. If the country code is 'FR', the download API endpoint will return a 403 Forbidden error.",YES
US/CA Stickers Rollout,"A new cosmetic 'Stickers' feature is being rolled out for market testing purposes. The initial launch will be limited to users in the United States and Canada.","PRD: The rollout is limited to the US and Canada to gather initial feedback before a global launch. This feature does not collect sensitive data or change any user reporting workflows.","TRD: The feature is enabled via a feature flag that is keyed off the user's country code. No other user data is accessed.",NO
Indonesian Age Verification (18+),"To comply with Indonesia's Child Protection Law, this feature requires all new users signing up from Indonesia to verify that they are over the age of 18.","PRD: All users with an Indonesian IP address must complete an age verification check at signup. This is a mandatory legal requirement. We will not store the ID document, only the verification status.","TRD: The system integrates with a local third-party service to perform age verification using the national ID card (KTP). The API call only returns a true/false age confirmation.",YES
Under-13 Signup with Names/Photos (US),"A new onboarding flow for our platform in the US that allows children under 13 to create accounts. The system collects the child's full name and profile photo.","PRD: To attract a younger audience, we are opening up registration to users under 13. We will collect their name and photo to personalize their experience. We plan to add parental consent functionality in a future release.","TRD: The 'users' table in the database will now store name and a link to a profile photo for users with an age below 13. There is no flag to indicate if parental consent has been obtained.",YES
Illegal Content Flags w/o Workflow (EU),"Users in the EU can flag content they believe is illegal, as per the Digital Services Act. However, there is no defined internal process for reviewing these flags or taking action.","PRD: A 'Report Illegal Content' button will be added to the UI for EU users. When clicked, it will log the report. A process for reviewing these reports is out of scope for V1.","TRD: The report button will trigger an API call that writes the report to a log file. There is no integration with a moderation queue, no SLA for review, and no transparency reporting mechanism.",YES
Teen Night Notifications (Florida),"The platform will send promotional push notifications to teenage users in Florida between the hours of 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM to drive engagement with new features.","PRD: To boost engagement metrics, we will run a notification campaign. The scheduler will be set to target US users aged 13-17, including those in Florida, during late-night hours. Parental controls for notifications are opt-in and disabled by default.","TRD: The push notification scheduler cron job is configured to run at 01:00 EST. The targeting query selects users where age > 12 AND age < 18 AND country = 'US'.",YES
Anonymous Usage with Ephemeral Logs,"The app can be used in a 'guest mode' without creating an account. All server-side logs generated during a guest session are fully anonymized and are automatically purged after 24 hours.","PRD: To prioritize user privacy, guest mode is designed to leave no trace. This aligns with data minimization principles under GDPR.","TRD: The web server will generate logs with the user's IP address replaced with '0.0.0.0'. A cron job runs daily at 4 AM UTC to execute a script that deletes all log files older than 24 hours.",NO
Liability Unclear for Shared Content,"A new feature that allows users to re-share content from other users. The legal team has noted that the law regarding liability for re-shared content is ambiguous in our target markets.","PRD: We are launching a 're-share' feature. The legal status is unclear, and we have not yet built a takedown flow for re-shared content based on copyright notices. We should flag this for review.","TRD: The 'shares' table simply contains a foreign key to the original content and the user who shared it. There is no legal hold or takedown status field in the schema.",UNSURE
